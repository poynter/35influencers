            <p>"... in 2009, I heard about Craig Kanalley's website, Breaking Tweets, which used Twitter as a reporting source. Writers placed tweets in their stories in the same way traditional reporters would quote sources. Besides illustrating how journalists could use social media to find sources and gauge reaction to a news event, it was an innovative way to integrate social media into narrative journalism." -- <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/myersnews/status/25724140657">Steve Myers</a><br /><br />"He leverages real-time updates &amp; community building in social media very well" -- <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/petersmeg">Meghan Peters</a></p>

        "<strong>Sarah Evans</strong>, Social Media Correspondent and founder of Sevans Strategy: Poynter says the people we choose can be from outside journalism, and in this case I veer off into the world of public relations (though she also loves journalism) to give Sarah the recognition she deserves. She has inspired me and given me ideas for how to be "real" in the social media space since I was a student at DePaul and in the same time zone as her. She built a true community on Twitter with her positive personality, uplifting attitude, and willingness to help others, a real network, also known as 50,000 followers today." -- <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=436635020973">Craig Kanalley </a>

<p><strong> Nominated by Alicia Stewart (@ombudsman), Anne Verwiebe (@monkeygrrl), Sarah Fidelibus (@verbalcupcake) and Mandy Jenkins (@mjenkins)</strong> </p>
        <p>"Andy Carvin is senior strategist on NPR's Social Media Desk, and he has a long history of experimenting with ways social media can be used not just by news organizations, but by citizens wanting to improve the world.  A great example of that history can be viewed in Carvin's TED talk, "The New Volunteers: Social Media, Disaster Response And You," in which he details -- through his firsthand experiences -- the evolution of online tools that help mobilize volunteers with a variety of skill sets to take action during crisis situations. After watching that video, even Malcolm Gladwell would be hard-pressed to continue to believe that social media tools have little effect in creating social change. Carvin's talk is inspiring, informative, engaging -- all the characteristics one would expect from a bright mind like his." -- <a href="http://sarahfidelibus.posterous.com/my-picks-for-poynters-p35-influential-people">Sarah Fidelibus</a></p>

He's always talking about issues in new media that reflect not only his experiences as a journalist in the UK (which is fascinating in and of itself), but also what's affecting new media across the world. OJB's explanatory posts on social media projects, tool how-tos, new policies and those who seek to shut such things down have been a constant source of ideas and inspiration for me. Also, in 2009, Paul founded Help Me Investigate, a platform for crowdsourcing investigative journalism.

        <p>"Vadim is a social media all-star, simply put, and the fact we're the same age is cool. I have always identified closely with him. He was among the first I followed on Twitter and his tweets are among the best you'll find when it comes to journalism and social media. It's been fun watching his career at this early stage, seeing him work on social projects at The New York Times and now at Mashable. He's among the best out there and it's because he LISTENS first and foremost. He is a great listener, and he has a true talent for picking important details out of the noise found in our info-overload world. He provides the perfect hook for his tweets, and he's always on top of the latest and greatest. And because he listens so well, he's incredibly smart and does an awesome job of advancing the conversation whether it be on Twitter, his personal blog or now Mashable.com." -- <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes.php?id=122407694453913&notes_tab=app_2347471856#!/note.php?note_id=436635020973">Craig Kanalley</a></p>

        <p>"Director of Community Engagement at <a href="http://www.tbd.com">TBD</a>: Steve's had an outstanding WordPress blog since Dec. 2008, and a stellar Twitter feed to go along with it, focusing on the ever-evolving nature of communication in our society and how the digital age has affected journalism. His social media tips and advice are often second-to-none and they were part of the inspiration behind my launching TwitterJournalism.com. Even though he was in Iowa, and now in D.C., and we've never met face-to-face (yet), he's had a profound impact on me and the way I think about social media. Especially with his current job -- community engagement -- he always has me thinking about new ways to engage folks and build community." -- <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes.php?id=122407694453913&notes_tab=app_2347471856#!/note.php?note_id=436635020973">Craig Kanalley</a></p>

        <p>"In addition to being the CEO of Storify, a tool through which people turn the information they source from social media into a compelling piece of journalism that tells a complete story, Herman is also founder of Hacks/Hackers, which brings journalists and technologists together to learn from one another. Since its launch in the Bay Area, Hacks/Hackers has held meetups in cities across the U.S. and in the U.K., clearly demonstrating how hungry people are for the kinds of networking and learning opportunities that these meetups provide. By providing the space -- both virtual and physical -- for journalists and techies to learn from one another, Herman's Hacks/Hackers helps to empower those who want to learn more about the integration of these two enterprises." -- <a href="http://sarahfidelibus.posterous.com/my-picks-for-poynters-p35-influential-people">Sarah Fidelibus </a></p>

<p><strong>Twitter bio: </strong>Welcome to Longshot Magazine, a raucous experiment in using new tools to erase media's old limits. We're going to write, design, edit, and ship a mag in 2 days.</p>
<p><strong> Nominated by: Ellyn Angelotti (@ellynangelotti)</strong> </p>
        <p>"Initially I thought this idea was brilliant because I thought their product would be a great way to memorialize a lot of the amazing ideas and thoughts people share in the very fluid social media world -- and it is! But it's also so much more. After talking more with Mathew about Longshot's process and workflow, I have even more respect for this great website/magazine/idea because of its ability to harness the power and velocity of the crowd while ensuring quality and standards are a priority. Obtaining this unique balance of two values results in Longshot being an up-and-coming innovative, interesting and credible voice in media.
