            <p>"... in 2009, I heard about Craig Kanalley's website, Breaking Tweets, which used Twitter as a reporting source. Writers placed tweets in their stories in the same way traditional reporters would quote sources. Besides illustrating how journalists could use social media to find sources and gauge reaction to a news event, it was an innovative way to integrate social media into narrative journalism." -- <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/myersnews/status/25724140657">Steve Myers</a><br /><br />"He leverages real-time updates &amp; community building in social media very well" -- <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/petersmeg">Meghan Peters</a></p>

        <p><strong>Nominated by Craig Kanalley and Ellyn Angelotti </strong>
        <p>
        "<strong>Sarah Evans</strong>, Social Media Correspondent and founder of Sevans Strategy: Poynter says the people we choose can be from outside journalism, and in this case I veer off into the world of public relations (though she also loves journalism) to give Sarah the recognition she deserves. She has inspired me and given me ideas for how to be "real" in the social media space since I was a student at DePaul and in the same time zone as her. She built a true community on Twitter with her positive personality, uplifting attitude, and willingness to help others, a real network, also known as 50,000 followers today. Follow count means little in the scheme of things, it's all about quality follows, but Sarah has so many of those because she is genuine and so helpful. She keeps it real on Twitter, she shares personal tidbits, and she's always engaging. Best of all: she takes the time to connect others. Sarah understand that social media is NOT about yourself, but it's about others, and that's why she founded #JournChat, which has become one of the most popular Twitter chats about journalism out there (it's every Monday night)." -- <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=436635020973">Craig Kanalley </a>
        <br/><br/>
        "<strong>Sarah's </strong>energy and entrepreneurial spirit are inspiring. I first "met" Sarah after tuning in to one of the first #journchat sessions (which she helped launch). Her approach to sharing news and working with others using social media have helped her to be a credible, informative and fun voice to that many look to for guidance about the future of journalism." -- <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes.php?id=122407694453913&notes_tab=app_2347471856#!/note.php?note_id=422518584332">Ellyn Angelotti</a>

<p><strong>Twitter bio:</strong>Senior strategist at NPR. Online community organizer since 1994. Former director of the Digital Divide Network. Blogger. Photographer. Dad. </p>

<p><strong> Nominated by Alicia Stewart (@ombudsman), Anne Verwiebe (@monkeygrrl), Sarah Fidelibus (@verbalcupcake) and Mandy Jenkins (@mjenkins)</strong> </p>
        <p>Andy Carvin is senior strategist on NPR's Social Media Desk, and he has a long history of experimenting with ways social media can be used not just by news organizations, but by citizens wanting to improve the world.  A great example of that history can be viewed in Carvin's TED talk, "The New Volunteers: Social Media, Disaster Response And You," in which he details -- through his firsthand experiences -- the evolution of online tools that help mobilize volunteers with a variety of skill sets to take action during crisis situations. After watching that video, even Malcolm Gladwell would be hard-pressed to continue to believe that social media tools have little effect in creating social change. Carvin's talk is inspiring, informative, engaging -- all the characteristics one would expect from a bright mind like his. -- <a href="http://sarahfidelibus.posterous.com/my-picks-for-poynters-p35-influential-people">Sarah Fidelibus</a></p>

<p><strong> Nominated by Mandy Jenkins (@mjenkins)</strong> </p>
        <p>Paul's Online Journalism Blog is probably linked more than any other from this site -- and for good reason. He's always talking about issues in new media that reflect not only his experiences as a journalist in the UK (which is fascinating in and of itself), but also what's affecting new media across the world. OJB's explanatory posts on social media projects, tool how-tos, new policies and those who seek to shut such things down have been a constant source of ideas and inspiration for me. Also, in 2009, Paul founded Help Me Investigate, a platform for crowdsourcing investigative journalism. Hard to top that. -- <a href="http://zombiejournalism.com/2010/10/four-who-influenced-my-approach-to-social-media/">Mandy Jenkins</a></p>

        <p>Vadim is a social media all-star, simply put, and the fact we're the same age is cool. I have always identified closely with him. He was among the first I followed on Twitter and his tweets are among the best you'll find when it comes to journalism and social media. It's been fun watching his career at this early stage, seeing him work on social projects at The New York Times and now at Mashable. He's among the best out there and it's because he LISTENS first and foremost. He is a great listener, and he has a true talent for picking important details out of the noise found in our info-overload world. He provides the perfect hook for his tweets, and he's always on top of the latest and greatest. And because he listens so well, he's incredibly smart and does an awesome job of advancing the conversation whether it be on Twitter, his personal blog or now Mashable.com. -- <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes.php?id=122407694453913&notes_tab=app_2347471856#!/note.php?note_id=436635020973">Craig Kanalley</a></p>

<p><strong> Nominated by Craig Kanalley (@ckanal) and Mandy Jenkins (@mjenkins)</strong> </p>
        <p>Director of Community Engagement at <a href="http://www.tbd.com">TBD</a>: Steve's had an outstanding WordPress blog since Dec. 2008, and a stellar Twitter feed to go along with it, focusing on the ever-evolving nature of communication in our society and how the digital age has affected journalism. His social media tips and advice are often second-to-none and they were part of the inspiration behind my launching TwitterJournalism.com. Even though he was in Iowa, and now in D.C., and we've never met face-to-face (yet), he's had a profound impact on me and the way I think about social media. Especially with his current job -- community engagement -- he always has me thinking about new ways to engage folks and build community. -- <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes.php?id=122407694453913&notes_tab=app_2347471856#!/note.php?note_id=436635020973">Craig Kanalley</a></p>
